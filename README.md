# TODO
- [x] Figure out how to make it simpler to rebuild and restart the simulator
- [ ] Figure out the building system (dependencies, root makefile vs CMAKELists, makefile in build folder, etc...)

# Notes
- Somehow calling fillRect before updateAndDrawSprites doesn't show rectangles at all. 
- Tracking is the name given to spacing between letters when working with fonts
