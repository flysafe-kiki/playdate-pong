# TODO Game Features
- [ ] Add audio
- [ ] Add FX Sprites
- [ ] Implement a menu / state machine
- [ ] Game Over system
- [ ] "slicing" logic = bigger racket delta when hitting the ball means more speed and / or curving the ball

# TODO C Learning
- [ ] Figure out the building system (dependencies, root makefile vs CMAKELists, makefile in build folder, etc...)
- [ ] Enable C Warnings
- [ ] Use closure equivalents to avoid declaring ball globally ?

# Notes
- Somehow calling fillRect before updateAndDrawSprites doesn't show rectangles at all. 
- Tracking is the name given to spacing between letters when working with fonts
